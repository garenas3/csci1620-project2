# CSCI 1620 Project 2

The purpose of this project is to assist in gardening activities. The first
part of the project will be to present frost dates to the user based on the ZIP
code they enter.

To get frost dates from NOAA stations, a location must be determined. This
location can be obtained from GeoNames API.

## GeoNames API

longitude coordinate pair.
